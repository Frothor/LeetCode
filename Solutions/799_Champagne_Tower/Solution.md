# LeetCode 799. Champagne Tower Solution
## Approach #1: Simulation [Accepted]
### Intuition

Instead of keeping track of how much champagne should end up in a glass, keep track of the total amount of champagne that flows through a glass. For example, if `poured = 10` cups are poured at the top, then the total flow-through of the top glass is `10`; the total flow-through of each glass in the second row is `4.5`, and so on.

### Algorithm

In general, if a glass has flow-through `X`, then `Q = (X - 1.0) / 2.0` quantity of champagne will equally flow left and right. We can simulate the entire pour for 100 rows of glasses. A glass at `(r, c)` will have excess champagne flow towards `(r+1, c)` and `(r+1, c+1)`

### Java
```java
class Solution {
    public double champagneTower(int poured, int query_row, int query_glass) {
        double[][] A = new double[102][102];
        A[0][0] = (double) poured;
        for (int r = 0; r <= query_row; ++r) {
            for (int c = 0; c <= r; ++c) {
                double q = (A[r][c] - 1.0) / 2.0;
                if (q > 0) {
                    A[r+1][c] += q;
                    A[r+1][c+1] += q;
                }
            }
        }

        return Math.min(1, A[query_row][query_glass]);
    }
}
```

### Python
```python
class Solution(object):
    def champagneTower(self, poured, query_row, query_glass):
        A = [[0] * k for k in xrange(1, 102)]
        A[0][0] = poured
        for r in xrange(query_row + 1):
            for c in xrange(r+1):
                q = (A[r][c] - 1.0) / 2.0
                if q > 0:
                    A[r+1][c] += q
                    A[r+1][c+1] += q

        return min(1, A[query_row][query_glass])
```

### Complexity Analysis

* Time Complexity: ***O(R^2)***, where ***R*** is the number of rows. As this is fixed, we can consider this complexity to be ***O(1)***.

* Space Complexity: ***O(R^2)***, or ***O(1)*** by the reasoning above.
