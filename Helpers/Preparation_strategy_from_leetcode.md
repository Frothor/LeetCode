# Preparation strategy from leetcode (important questions)
I am going to discuss the strategy to prepare for your interviews using leetcode.

**Depending on the time you have we will be discussing 2 strategies.**
**I will provide some very good resources below.**
*Let me clear that this might not be the most optimal way but it sure will help you cover most of the important topics that might be asked during the technical interviews.*

### 1-Having 3+ months time
1- The very first thing is to be consistent in the weekly coding contest and after the contest do upsolving (reading the solutions and discussing).
2- For those who have hard time with medium problems during contest should do atleast 50 easy problems(sorted by difficulty)
3- If you find difficulty in any topic , then you have an option to sort problems according that topic and start solving.
4- With this you also have time to prepare for other subjects (DBMS, OOPS , OS are 3 most important).

### 2-Having about a month time
1- You should be focusing on covering most important questions (which will teach you many concepts and approaches)
2- Do questions topic wise and coompany wise.
3- I am providing the compiled list of all important problems from each topic and companies with their detailed soltuions (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IES8uw9f4w9iCsIoArUioYB8ctVRR-TaA1Qu4YhcQ9U/edit?usp=sharing)
